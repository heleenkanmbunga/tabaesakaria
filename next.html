      <h2>why i love you </h2>
      <p>I love the quiet hum when you're near, a melody I crave,<br>
        The way sunlight catches in your hair, a golden, gentle wave.<br>
        I love the crinkle by your eyes when a genuine smile takes hold,<br>
        And stories only your kind touch can ever truly unfold.
        </p>
        <p>I love the patience in your gaze when my thoughts run wild and free,<br>
        The unwavering strength you show, simply by being you, with me.<br>
        I love the way you listen close, to worries I barely share,<br>
        And the silent understanding that banishes every fear.
        </p>
        <p>I love the comfort in your presence, a harbor from the storm,<br>
        The way your hand fits into mine, keeping my spirit warm.<br>
        I love the small, forgotten gestures, noticed only by my heart,<br>
        The subtle ways you show you care, right from the very start.
        </p>
        <p>I love the shared laughter that escapes, a joyous, soaring sound,<br>
        And the peaceful quiet we embrace, when no words need be found.<br>
        I love the way you challenge me, to grow beyond my ken,<br>
        And the gentle reassurance that I'm enough, again and again.
        </p>
        <p>I love the dreams we build together, brick by hopeful brick,<br>
        The future stretching out before us, so vivid, close, and quick.<br>
        I love the solace of your voice, a balm upon my soul,<br>
        Making fractured pieces whole, making me truly whole.
        </p>
        <p>And though a million reasons dance, beyond my ability to tell,<br>
        Each one a silent promise, where my deepest feelings dwell.<br>
        It's not just one, or two, or three, but all of them combined,<br>
        The quiet, profound beauty of the love in you I find.
        </p>
